     Rather than
     `\includegraphics[whatever]{whatever}`
     one should now write
     `\includegraphics[whatever,alt={This is the alternative text.}]{whatever}`
     The alternative text will be ignored if tagging is not used. See comments in [[1]](#ref1). It seems that draft mode doesn’t work at present.
     An old issue with height appears to be fixed.
